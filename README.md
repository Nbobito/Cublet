# Cublet
A new type of speedcube algorithm trainer

### How it works
Cublet is not like a normal algoritm trainer. A regular trainer gives you a scramble, then you solve that scramble while you time yourself. Cublet, on the otherhand does not give you the scramble, and instead just shows you the case on screen. You ignore the actual position of the cube, and just pay attention to executing the algoritim as fast as you can. As you get faster and faster, you will start to get muscle memory for that algoritm, and will eventually be able to "pass off" a time. After you pass off a specific time, Cublet will give you a new algorithm to learn and practice.

### Features
As Cublet is still in development, all that there is for now is a timer and decent GUI. When the first functioning version is released, it will have cases and the algorithms to solve them, a few algoritm sets, customisible practice options, and possibly more. In future versions I am currently thinking of adding user account support, so you can save your times and access you account from other devices. 

### Updates
It times now!
